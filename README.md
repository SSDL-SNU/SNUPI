# SNUPI
  Structured Nucleic Acids Programming Interface is a multiscale analysis framework for nucleic acid nanostructures based on the finite element model with the geometric and mechanical properties of DNA characterized by molecular dynamics simulation.  

# Prerequisite
  - The correct version of the MATLAB Runtime (version 9.6 (R2019a)) must be installed.
  - Download and install its Windows version at "http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html".

# Procedure (win)
  - Execute 'SNUPI_GUI.exe'
  - Select a cadnano design file and options.
  - Run SNUPI and analyze the results.
  - Refer to 'readme' and 'Protocol.pdf' for more details on the program.
  
# Procedure (mac, linux)
  - Modify 'Input.txt' to indicate a cadnano design file and options.
  - Execute SNUPI as ./run_SNUPI.sh <matlab_runtime_directory>
  - Analyze the results.
  - Refer to 'readme' and 'Protocol.pdf' for more details on the program.
